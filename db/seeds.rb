    name: "Dragon's Breath", description: "'Dragon's Breath is a rare, beautiful, special collector's hibiscus that can be a challenge to grow. This offspring of 'Bonnie B' and 'Blushing Romance' has won dozens of hibiscus show awards, including Hibiscus of the Year. It has striking 7-9\" single, maroon flowers with frosty white rays and brush strokes on each petal. The compact, somewhat slow-growing bush prefers a mix of direct sun and shade, and blooms best in filtered light or part shade in the heat of summer. It can be grown as a potted plant or planted in the garden. It can have problems if over-watered in milder weather but also needs ample water when the temperatures are high. 'Dragon's Breath' is highly recommended for those with experience growing hybrid hibiscus."

    name: "Wow Factor", description: "Exotic hibiscus 'Wow Factor' blooms with a 7-9 inches single in multiple shades of yellow, orange, pink, blue, and lilac with a red eye. The colors vary with the weather, but it is always beautiful. In high heat, on the second or third day it fades to a softer yellow with a blue body and red eye, which is very different but still beautiful. 'Wow Factor' looks like a more vivid version of its mother 'Moonstruck' with more blue in its body from father 'Rocket's Red Glare.' The bush is medium sized, upright and a great bloomer. Released from HVH in 2014. Hybridizer: C. Black"

    name: "Sea of Tranquility", description: "'Sea of Tranquility' blooms with luminescent 6-8\" single flowers that glow like the lunar Sea of Tranquility. 'Sea of Tranquility' has some of our most variable flowers. They typically open in a dark purplish blue with a brown, orange, or yellow edge set off by white rays. In heat and sun, it softens to a softer blue and yellow. The width of the edge varies greatly with temperature, as does the white halo and depth of the rays. The parents of 'Sea of Tranquility' are the classic hibiscus varieties 'Crème de Cacao' and 'Moon Madness.' The bush is upright, well branched, medium-sized, and easy to grow. Released from HVH in 2010. Hybridizer: C. Black"
